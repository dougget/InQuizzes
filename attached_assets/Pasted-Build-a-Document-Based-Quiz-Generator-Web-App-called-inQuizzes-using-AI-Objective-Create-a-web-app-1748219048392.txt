Build a Document-Based Quiz Generator Web App called inQuizzes using AI

Objective:
Create a web app called inQuizzes that allows students to upload a PDF document (up to 15MB) and receive a high-quality, AI-generated quiz to test their understanding of the documentâ€™s content. The app uses DeepSeek's free-tier API for question generation and emphasizes quality and relevance in its output.

Core Requirements:

ðŸ“„ Document Handling
Accept only PDF files.

Enforce a maximum file size of 15MB.

Extract document content locally in the browser or backend, without using external services.

If the document exceeds DeepSeekâ€™s token limit, split the content into smaller, manageable chunks and process them sequentially or in parallel, ensuring questions cover the full document.

ðŸ§  AI Integration
Use DeepSeek API (free tier) for generating quiz questions.

Ensure questions are:

Highly elaborate and content-focused.

Free from any reference to metadata (e.g., title, headings, structure).

Generate up to 50 questions as per user selection.

ðŸ’¡ UX/UI Specifications
A minimalist, elegant design.

Dark/light mode switching:

Auto-switch based on user's system preferences.

Manual toggle button to override.

Drag-and-drop + file picker zone with:

Visual indicators for PDF-only and 15MB limit.

A single slider for selecting the number of questions (1â€“50).

A single "Generate Quiz" button that:

Doubles as a loading/progress bar during document processing and quiz generation.

On quiz completion:

Display all generated questions.

For incorrectly answered ones, show the correct answer with a brief explanation.

Tech Stack Suggestions:

Frontend: React (with Tailwind or minimal CSS-in-JS), optionally Next.js

Backend: Node.js with Express or serverless functions (e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare Workers)

PDF Parsing: pdfjs-dist or pdf-parse for Node.js

State Management: Context API or Zustand

AI Call Management: Axios/fetch with error and token handling logic for DeepSeek

Final Note:
Prioritize user experience and quiz accuracy over speed. The goal is to help learners deeply reflect on their understanding.
